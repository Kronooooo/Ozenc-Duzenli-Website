                    <p>Ozenc (also known as Ozzy) is a guitarist born and raised in London, United Kingdom and is currently based in New York City after having recently graduated from the Conservatory of Purchase College with a Masterâ€™s degree in Jazz Studies where he studied with world renowned Jazz guitarist Pasquale Grasso. Ozzy is currently working on releasing his first EP as a leader in the summer of 2021, whilst preparing for upcoming performances in New York City. <br><br>
                        Ozzy spent his time in London playing in the Urban Big Band, playing funk, jazz and latin music before changing to the Portland Place Big Band having a similar role. He has also been recorded in a variety of situations such as in a duo, trio and quartet. Including all of these groups, of which he has performed with he has also performed with bands playing Jazz across London. He is also a co-leader of a new Quintet called Yiasena, alongside Saxophonist Sofia Roubati. <br><br>
                        Ozzy originally started playing pop, rock and blues, at the age of 11. Soon after, he began to take lessons from renowned Jazz Guitarist Cameron Pierre (who plays regularly with UK Jazz legends Courtney Pine and Byron Wallen), and this is where his interest in Jazz began to grow. At the age of 13 Ozzy had a chance to play at the Barbican with players from Jazz at Lincoln Centre. This experience became one of the reasons why Ozzy started to become obsessed with music and the thrill of performing. <br><br>
                        Ozzy decided to continue his music education by studying at Middlesex University in London. It was at Middlesex (studying guitar under Al Cherry and Stuart Hall), where he delved into the music of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and Barry Harris. The deep dive he took into studying these musicians led to his dream that one day he would live in New York City. After graduating from Middlesex University in London with a BA in Jazz,  he has performed at venues and events in the U.K. such as The Chickenshed Theatre, The Vortex Jazz club, the Hackney Empire, the Lancaster Jazz Festival, and with his band Yiasena who he co-leads with Sofia Roubati at the Preveza Jazz Festival (North Greece), Booze Cooperativa (Athens, Greece) and Neuf (Athens, Greece).<br><br>
